1. After signing in, go to the menu item 
"Manage database/Account" and create your money accounts 
(bank accounts, cash in different currency) 

2. After creating at least one account, go to the menu item 
"Manage database/Ledger" and create all the necessary income/expense items

3. All the tables (but "User") of menu "Manage database" contains actions:
	a) create a new
	b) edit existing
	c) view details of an entry
	d) delete an entry

4. For short tutorial, use test database initialisation (see the file ReadMe_DbInitialization.txt).
Then you may use Report menu. 
BE CAREFUL when selecting menu item "Database Initialization/Clear..." - all the data are removed without ability to restoring
